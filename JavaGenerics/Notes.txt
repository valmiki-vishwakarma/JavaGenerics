Need of Generics in Java
We need to create different classes for different data types
Without generics,it throws ClassCastException at run time not at compile time

So, we create a generic class with type as T 
so that it works fine for all the data types

T==>It is not mandatory to use T only
Instead of T, we can use any random java identifier or name like A,B,C or Steve etc

But T is the standard practise 
Generic is used to parametrize the class as <T>
We can parametrize generic class or interface or methods
=====================================================================
Generics in Java

In Java SE7 and later, you can replace the type arguments required to invoke 
the constructor of a generic class with an empty <> set of type argument as below

//String 
StoreAnyValueWithGenerics<String> s3=new StoreAnyValueWithGenerics<>("Steve");
String val3=s3.getValue();
System.out.println(val3);
